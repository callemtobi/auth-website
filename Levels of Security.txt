<-- ENCRYPTION LEVELS -->

Level 1 - User authentication using email and password. 
          Store passwords in plain text in db.
          Stored in server level (atleast not in source code after inspecting html).

Level 2 - Encryption (Database): Scrambling the original data.
          NPM Package: mongoose-encryption 
                    - Encryption [AES-256-CBC] - Advanced Encryption Standard, 
                      encrypt sensitive data, such as financial transactions and 
                      personal information. Algorithm.
                    - Authentication [HMAC-SHA-512] - cryptographic process that 
                      authenticates messages using a secret key and the SHA-512 hash function.
                      A member of the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2).
                      A secret key is mixed with the message data and hashes the result. 
                      The hash value is mixed with the secret key again, and then hashed a second time.
